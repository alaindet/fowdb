# FoWDB - Force of Will Database

Force of Will Database (https://www.fowdb.altervista.org) is a fan site about Force of Will TCG, an amazing japanese trading card game.

FoWDB started as (and still is) a personal experiment to learn web development via books and tutorials. As a matter of fact, it lacks some best practices and cool new features and that's why this repository exists: it serves as an experiment to refactor FoWDB entirely to meet today's best practices.

## Technology

FoWDB is simply a LAMP website written in plain old PHP and MySQL, without any framework. It's currently hosted on a free hosting and it doesn't follow a full MVC OOP approach at the moment, but I'm working on it to turn it into a reasonable MVC OOP website, as it should. Please be kind while reviewing it!
