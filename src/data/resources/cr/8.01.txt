If that card would be played via an effect that states play that cardwithout paying its cost, if there is no rule or text that indicates a value ofthat integer, then that integer is always zero. Likewise, if a card or abilitystext would alter the cost of an uncertain cost represented by X or Y (Ex:You pay [2] to play this card this turn). The value of that integer is stillzero.
_____903.2f-ii. If a J-ruler enters the field with an ability that includes a value of X,and that X value is not defined by the J-ruler sides text, and that J-rulersruler side included a judgment with an X value, then follow theseinstructions if the judgment with an X value was the reason the J-ruler wasput into the field. The value that was paid for the X of the judgment is thevalue of the X ability on the J-ruler side.
_____903.2f-iii. If a method to determine the value of X is outlined via rules or text,and X is information needed to play the card (cost, number of targets,information of targets, etc), determine the X value at this time.

_____903.2h-i. Assigning things to multiple targets is included in this stipulation. Ifsuch an event occurs where a player assigns something other than damage,it must be assigned in positive values that are multiples of 1. If such anevent occurs where a player assigns damage to multiple resonators it mustbe assigned in positive values that are multiples of 100.
_____903.2h-ii. The contents of what is to be applied are fixed at this time. Afterthis point, the contents to be applied by the card or ability cannot bealtered or changed.
____903.2i. If that card or ability requires any sort of action to be played, handle thoseactions in the order detailed below;

_____903.2i-iv. Apply any effects decreasing the quantity. To do this, the playerwho plays it chooses which part they decrease.

If the turn player doesn't play any automatic objects, then the non-turn playerchecks if they control any triggered automatic objects, choose one of those abilities andplay it if there are any, then decrease the number of times that object was triggered byone.
____906.5a. If any player played an automatic object, repeat this priority sequence fromthe beginning. If neither player played any automatic object, the turn playerperforms an available action.
___906.6. Triggered automatic objects have to be played unless it is prohibited by rules oreffects. Players cannot choose not to play them. If a player chooses an triggeredautomatic object but cannot play it for any reason, just decrease the number of timesthat object was triggered by one.
____906.6a. If you cannot play the automatic card for any reason, put it into owner'sgraveyard.
___906.7. Some automatic objects trigger when a card moves from one zone to another. Ifthese objects refer to the moved card or other cards moved at the same time, they referto the information or status of the card as below:
____906.7a. If the card moved from a public zone to a hidden zone, or a hidden zone toa public zone, the ability refers to the card when it's in public zone.
____906.7b. If the card moved from a ruler area or the field to an area that is not a rulerarea or the field, or vice versa, the ability refers to the card when it's in thefield or a ruler area.
____906.7c. Otherwise, the ability refers to a card when it's in destination zone.
___906.8. Some effects make automatic abilities trigger later at a specific time. This ability iscalled a delayed automatic ability.
____906.8a. A delayed automatic ability is, unless otherwise specified, triggered onceand once only at the time it specified. After that, even in the same situation, itdoesn't trigger again.
____906.8b. If something refers to a card with a delayed automatic ability, it refers acard with an ability that makes that delayed trigger ability.
___906.9. Some automatic objects watch if a specific status is fulfilled during a game. Theseobjects are called status automatic objects.
____906.9a. A status automatic object is only triggered when it's not already triggeredand the status is fulfilled.

(This includes not triggering automaticobjects with the condition of "doing Judgment".)
