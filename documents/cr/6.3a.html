When an effect instructs you to do something a number of times and you cannot do it fully, you still do it as many times as possible. If you would perform something zero or a negative amount of times, you don't perform it at all.

</li><li class="fd-cr-bdy__3"><a href="#105.3" name="105.3">105.3.</a> Control: During a game, all cards, abilities and effects are controlled by a player. A player who controls cards, abilities, or effects is the controller of them. If a card or an ability refers to "you", it refers to its controller. If no controller-changing effects have been applied, the controller of a card, ability, or effect is determined as below:
<ul><li class="fd-cr-bdy__4"><a href="#105.3a" name="105.3a">105.3a.</a> The controller of a card is the owner of it.
</li><li class="fd-cr-bdy__4"><a href="#105.3b" name="105.3b">105.3b.</a> The controller of an ability is the controller of the card with that ability.
</li><li class="fd-cr-bdy__4"><a href="#105.3c" name="105.3c">105.3c.</a> The controller of an effect is the controller of the ability generates that effect.
</ul></li></li><li class="fd-cr-bdy__3"><a href="#105.4" name="105.4">105.4.</a> Life Points: Each player has a number called their life points. If a player has a life point total of 0 or below, they lose the game.
<ul><li class="fd-cr-bdy__4"><a href="#105.4a" name="105.4a">105.4a.</a> Life points is increased and decreased by a multiple of one hundred. If an effects instruct player to pay any amount of life points, they pays it by a multiple of one hundred.
</li><li class="fd-cr-bdy__4"><a href="#105.4b" name="105.4b">105.4b.</a> If a card refers to 'life', it refers to life points.

</li><li class="fd-cr-bdy__4"><a href="#201.4b" name="201.4b">201.4b.</a> A magic stone card with the same card name as a magic stone type has that magic stone type.
</li><li class="fd-cr-bdy__4"><a href="#201.4c" name="201.4c">201.4c.</a> If something refers to a magic stone type name (without any quotation symbol), it refers to cards with that magic stone type.

</ul></li></li><li class="fd-cr-bdy__3"><a href="#201.5" name="201.5">201.5.</a> If a card is referred to by its type name without specifying what zone it's in, the card in a play ground is affected.

<ul><li class="fd-cr-bdy__4"><a href="#202.3a" name="202.3a">202.3a.</a> If an effect says "a card with "(word(s))" in it" or something similar, that refers a part of a name. Otherwise, it refers a card with that word(s). Ex. "If you control "Hansel"" means "If you control a card with the exact name "Hansel". Even if you control "Hansel and Gretel", it doesn't fulfill the condition. Ex. If something says "if you control a card with "Hansel" in its name", the condition is fulfilled by controlling "Hansel" and/or "Hansel and Gretel".

Also, it stops to apply if the card stops fulfilling the condition. In this case, conditions are part of that continuous effect. It is not checked when the effect is made, and the effect is made whether the condition is met or not. Ex. If you play and resolve "Knight of the Round Table J/resonators you control gain +200/+200." spell, J/resonators put into your field after that still gains +200/+200. Ex. If you play and resolve an activate ability "If your J-ruler is "Faria, the Ruler of God Sword", you may pay [2] less to play its God's Art this turn." while you don't control any J-ruler, then you control "Faria, the Ruler of God Sword" after that, you may pay [2] less to play its God's Art.

That point in time is when the card triggers. Examples: "At end of turn" or "When a resonator enters your opponentâs field", Prison in the Lunar Lake
