</span><ul><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='104.1' href='#104.1'>104.1.</a>&nbsp;If the comprehensive rules and text of a card are contradictory, the card text takes precedence.
</li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='104.2' href='#104.2'>104.2.</a>&nbsp;When an effect instructs you to do something, and part of it is impossible to do, you do any other part of the effect that you can legally do. When an effect instructs you to do something a number of times and you cannot do it fully, you still do it as many times as possible. If you would perform something zero or a negative amount of times, you don't perform it at all.
</li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='104.3' href='#104.3'>104.3.</a>&nbsp;If an effect resolved and the status of a card or a player changes to the same status as before, it's not treated as &quot;becoming&quot; that status.
</li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='104.4' href='#104.4'>104.4.</a>&nbsp;If an effect prohibits doing something and another effect instructs a player to do that, the prohibiting effect takes precedence.
</li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='104.5' href='#104.5'>104.5.</a>&nbsp;If an effect instructs you to choose a number, you need to choose an integer of 0 or higher.
</li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='104.6' href='#104.6'>104.6.</a>&nbsp;If a value becomes a different value, if the latter is greater than the former, the value is considered increased. If the latter is lesser, the value is considered decreased. Including if the value is set to a specific number, or if a value is switched with another.
</li></ul></li><hr><li class='cr__par__1'><span class='cr__par__1__title'><a name='105' href='#105'>105.</a>&nbsp;Basic Concept
</span><ul><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='105.1' href='#105.1'>105.1.</a>&nbsp;Player: One who plays the game. On each turn, the player who performs the turn is called the turn player, and the other player is called the non-turn player.
</li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='105.2' href='#105.2'>105.2.</a>&nbsp;Owner: The owner of a card is the player who brings the card at the beginning of the game.
</li><li class='cr__par__2'><span class='cr__par__2__title'><a name='105.3' href='#105.3'>105.3.</a>&nbsp;Control: During a game, all cards, abilities and effects are controlled by a player. A player who controls cards, abilities, or effects is the controller of them. If a card or an ability refers to &quot;you&quot;, it refers to its controller. If no controller-changing effects have been applied, the controller of a card, ability, or effect is determined as below:
</span><ul><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='105.3a' href='#105.3a'>105.3a.</a>&nbsp;The controller of a card is the owner of it.
</li><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='105.3b' href='#105.3b'>105.3b.</a>&nbsp;The controller of an ability is the controller of the card with that ability.
</li><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='105.3c' href='#105.3c'>105.3c.</a>&nbsp;The controller of an effect is the controller of the ability generates that effect.
</li></ul></li><li class='cr__par__2'><span class='cr__par__2__title'><a name='105.4' href='#105.4'>105.4.</a>&nbsp;Life Points: Each player has a number called their life points. If a player has a life point total of 0 or below, they lose the game.
</span><ul><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='105.4a' href='#105.4a'>105.4a.</a>&nbsp;Life points is increased and decreased by a multiple of one hundred. If an effects instruct player to pay any amount of life points, they pays it by a multiple of one hundred.
</li><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='105.4b' href='#105.4b'>105.4b.</a>&nbsp;If a card refers to 'life', it refers to life points.

</span><ul><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='201.1' href='#201.1'>201.1.</a>&nbsp;The group this card belongs to.

</li><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='201.2b' href='#201.2b'>201.2b.</a>&nbsp;In the comprehensive rules and in card text, &quot;ruler or J-ruler&quot; is written as &quot;J/ruler&quot;.
</li></ul></li><li class='cr__par__2'><span class='cr__par__2__title'><a name='201.3' href='#201.3'>201.3.</a>&nbsp;Some cards have a general type. A general type is a phrase before a type name.
</span><ul><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='201.3a' href='#201.3a'>201.3a.</a>&nbsp;Some magic stone cards have the general type &quot;Special&quot;.
</li><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='201.3b' href='#201.3b'>201.3b.</a>&nbsp;Some magic stone and J/ruler cards have the general type &ldquo;Basic&rdquo;.
</li></ul></li><li class='cr__par__2'><span class='cr__par__2__title'><a name='201.4' href='#201.4'>201.4.</a>&nbsp;Some cards have a magic stone type.
</span><ul><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='201.4a' href='#201.4a'>201.4a.</a>&nbsp;The magic stone types are &quot;Light Magic Stone&quot;, &quot;Fire Magic Stone&quot;, &quot;Water Magic Stone&quot;, &quot;Wind Magic Stone&quot; and &quot;Darkness Magic Stone&quot;.
</li><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='201.4b' href='#201.4b'>201.4b.</a>&nbsp;A magic stone card with the same card name as a magic stone type has that magic stone type.
</li><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='201.4c' href='#201.4c'>201.4c.</a>&nbsp;If something refers to a magic stone type name (without any quotation symbol), it refers to cards with that magic stone type.
</li><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='201.4d' href='#201.4d'>201.4d.</a>&nbsp;Even if a card becomes or is considered/treated as a magic stone, it does not inherently have the ability to produce will unless specified.
</li></ul></li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='201.5' href='#201.5'>201.5.</a>&nbsp;If a card is referred to by its type name without specifying what zone it's in, the card in the field or a ruler area is affected. If a card is referred to by its &quot;(type name) card&quot; in a zone, it refers to a card with that type in that zone.
</li></ul></li><hr><li class='cr__par__1'><span class='cr__par__1__title'><a name='202' href='#202'>202.</a>&nbsp;Name

</li><li class='cr__par__2'><span class='cr__par__2__title'><a name='202.3' href='#202.3'>202.3.</a>&nbsp;If an effect refers a name with &quot;&quot; (double quotation symbol), it refers &quot;a card with that name&quot; or &quot;a part of a name&quot;, depending on the context.
</span><ul><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='202.3a' href='#202.3a'>202.3a.</a>&nbsp;If an effect says &quot;a card with &quot;(word(s))&quot; in it&quot; or something similar, that refers a part of a name. Otherwise, it refers a card with that word(s). Ex. &quot;If you control &quot;Hansel&quot;&quot; means &quot;If you control a card with the exact name &ldquo;Hansel&quot;. Even if you control &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, it doesn't fulfill the condition. Ex. If something says &quot;if you control a card with &quot;Hansel&quot; in its name&quot;, the condition is fulfilled by controlling &quot;Hansel&quot; and/or &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;.

</li><li class='cr__par__2'><span class='cr__par__2__title'><a name='203.5' href='#203.5'>203.5.</a>&nbsp;The total cost is the number of wills needed for the attribute cost plus the number on the free cost.
</span><ul><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='203.5a' href='#203.5a'>203.5a.</a>&nbsp;If a card doesn't have any cost, the total cost of that card is 0.
</li><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='203.5b' href='#203.5b'>203.5b.</a>&nbsp;If a card has a free cost of X, X is the value you chose when paying for the card, while the card is on the chase. When that card is anywhere else, treat the value of X as zero.

</li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='204.4' href='#204.4'>204.4.</a>&nbsp;Some cards have sentences with different font in their card text area. These sentences are called flavor text and have no rule purpose.

</span><ul><li class='cr__par__3'><a name='205.1a' href='#205.1a'>205.1a.</a>&nbsp;You may treat races and traits as the same thing. When a text refers &quot;race&quot;, it also refers &quot;trait&quot; and vice versa.
</li></ul></li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='205.2' href='#205.2'>205.2.</a>&nbsp;A card's race and trait are written on right side of its type. Trait is written inside of parentheses.

</li><li class='cr__par__2'><a name='205.4' href='#205.4'>205.4.</a>&nbsp;A race or trait itself doesn't have any specific rules, though they are referred to by some abilities and effects. If an effect refers to a race or trait without specifying what zone it's in, it refers to cards in the field or a ruler area with that race or trait.
