100.  Overview
101. General
101.1. This document is the description of the rules for Force of Will.
102. Number of players
102.1. This game is played by two players.
103. How to win
103.1. During the game, players fulfilling the losing condition lose the game.
103.2. If a player loses the game and the other one hasn't, the player not losing the game wins.
103.3. If both players lose the game at the same time, the game ends in draw.
103.4. During a game, players may concede the game and leave from it. In this case, his or her opponent wins. Conceding the game is not replaced by any effects and no effects force players to concede.
104. Golden rules of the game
104.1. If the comprehensive rules and text of a card are contradictory, the card text takes precedence.
104.2. When an effect instructs you to do something, and part of it is impossible to do, you do any other part of the effect that you can legally do. When an effect instructs you to do something a number of times and you cannot do it fully, you still do it as many times as possible. If you would perform something zero or a negative amount of times, you don't perform it at all.
104.3. If an effect resolved and the status of a card or a player changes to the same status as before, it's not treated as "becoming" that status.
104.4. If an effect prohibits doing something and another effect instructs a player to do that, the prohibiting effect takes precedence.
104.5. If an effect instructs you to choose a number, you need to choose an integer of 0 or higher.
104.6. If a value becomes a different value, if the latter is greater than the former, the value is considered increased. If the latter is lesser, the value is considered decreased. Including if the value is set to a specific number, or if a value is switched with another.
105. Basic Concept
105.1. Player: One who plays the game. On each turn, the player who performs the turn is called the turn player, and the other player is called the non-turn player.
105.2. Owner: The owner of a card is the player who brings the card at the beginning of the game.
105.3. Control: During a game, all cards, abilities and effects are controlled by a player. A player who controls cards, abilities, or effects is the controller of them. If a card or an ability refers to "you", it refers to its controller. If no controller-changing effects have been applied, the controller of a card, ability, or effect is determined as below:
105.3a. The controller of a card is the owner of it.
105.3b. The controller of an ability is the controller of the card with that ability.
105.3c. The controller of an effect is the controller of the ability generates that effect.
105.4. Life Points: Each player has a number called their life points. If a player has a life point total of 0 or below, they lose the game.
105.4a. Life points is increased and decreased by a multiple of one hundred. If an effects instruct player to pay any amount of life points, they pays it by a multiple of one hundred.
105.4b. If a card refers to 'life', it refers to life points.
200.  Characteristics of Cards
201. Type
201.1. The group this card belongs to.
201.2. Categories of cards: "ruler", "J-ruler", "magic stone", "resonator", "chant", "addition" or "regalia".

201.2b. In the comprehensive rules and in card text, "ruler or J-ruler" is written as "J/ruler".
201.3. Some cards have a general type. A general type is a phrase before a type name.
201.3a. Some magic stone cards have the general type "Special".
201.4. Some cards have a magic stone type.
201.4a. The magic stone types are "Light Magic Stone", "Fire Magic Stone", "Water Magic Stone", "Wind Magic Stone" and "Darkness Magic Stone".
201.4b. A magic stone card with the same card name as a magic stone type has that magic stone type.
201.4c. If something refers to a magic stone type name (without any quotation symbol), it refers to cards with that magic stone type.
201.4d. Even if a card becomes or is considered/treated as a magic stone, it does not inherently have the ability to produce will unless specified.
201.5. If a card is referred to by its type name without specifying what zone it's in, the card in a play ground is affected. If a card is referred to by its "(type name) card" in a zone, it refers to a card with that type in that zone.
202. Name
202.1. Name of the card.
202.2. A name is referred to when you build your deck as part of its restrictions.
202.3. If an effect refers a name with "" (double quotation symbol), it refers "a card with that name" or "a part of a name", depending on the context.
202.3a. If an effect says "a card with "(word(s))" in it" or something similar, that refers a part of a name. Otherwise, it refers a card with that word(s). Ex. "If you control "Hansel"" means "If you control a card with the exact name “Hansel". Even if you control "Hansel and Gretel", it doesn't fulfill the condition. Ex. If something says "if you control a card with "Hansel" in its name", the condition is fulfilled by controlling "Hansel" and/or "Hansel and Gretel".
203. Cost
203.1. The information referred to when you play this card.
203.2. Cost includes the attribute cost that is paid with a specified attribute of will and free cost that is paid for with any kind of will.

203.4. A free cost is shown by the number in the center of the cost. You need to pay a number of will of any kind equal to the number printed here.
203.5. The total cost is the number of wills needed for the attribute cost plus the number on the free cost.
203.5a. If a card doesn't have any cost, the total cost of that card is 0.
203.5b. If a card has a free cost of X, X is the value you chose when paying for the card, while the card is on the chase. When that card is anywhere else, treat the value of X as zero.
203.6. If this card has [Quickcast](1111), a lightning art is shown around the cost to represent this.
204. Text
204.1. The abilities of this card.
204.2. If a card has more than one paragraph in its text, each of them is different ability.
204.3. Some text contains sentences with parentheses describing the ability. This is called reminder text and not considered part of the ability.

205.2. A card's race and trait are written on right side of its type. Trait is written inside of parentheses.
205.3. If there is no "/" (slash) in the race or trait, it that race or trait is one phrase. If there are any "/" (slash), each of the phrases separated by "/" is a different phrase for a race or trait.
205.4. A race or trait itself doesn't have any specific rules, though they are referred to by some abilities and effects. If an effect refers to a race or trait without specifying what zone it's in, it refers to cards in a play ground with that race or trait.

302.1. During a game, cards are placed in one of several places called zones. Each player has their own zones except for the chase area.
302.2. Each zone is divided into "public zone" and "hidden zone". Each player can see information of the cards in a public zone. Each player cannot see information of cards in a hidden zone, except for a player specifically allowed to see them by rules or effects.
302.2a. Each player can see the number of cards in a zone regardless if it's public or hidden.
302.3. If a card moves from one zone to another, or if it moves from playground to playground, it's treated as the same card and keeps its orientation. Otherwise, it's treated as a new card in a new zone. Unless otherwise specified, any effect applied in an older zone is not applied to the new card.
302.4. If more than one card is moved to a new zone and the order of cards in new zone is managed, the owner of those cards decides the order of them in the new zone. If the new zone is hidden, players other than owner of the cards moved cannot know the order of the cards in the new zone.

303.1b. When a card is placed in a zone where the card’s orientation is specified, it’s placed recovered.
303.2. In some zones, a card has a specified orientation of either face up or face down. A face up card is placed so that all the information on the card is visible, and a face down card is placed so that all the information on the card is hidden. A hidden card’s information can be checked at anytime by a player if they know the information of the cards (because they were moved from public zone, for example).

305. Magic Stone Deck
305.1. The zone a player put his magic stone deck in.
305.2. Each player has their own magic stone deck zone, it’s hidden and the order of the cards is managed. The order of cards is managed by stacking them.

307.2. Each player has their own field, it’s public and the order of the cards is not managed.
307.3. In a field, a card has a specified orientation, recovered or rested.
307.4. If text refers to a "card" without the zone it's in, it refers to a card in a field. If a text refers to a "Resonator", "J-ruler", "Addition", "Regalia" or "Magic Stone" without the zone it's in, it refers to a card of the specified type in a field.
307.4a. If a card’s text counts a number cards with certain information without specifying the zone they're in, it refers to cards in a play ground.
307.5. Each player can see the ruler side of a J-ruler card in a field.
307.6. If a card moves from a field to another, it's not considered as "entered" that field, "put into" that field, or “leaving a field for a non-field zone”.

308.5. The face down side of a card in a ruler area can be seen only by its controller.
309. Graveyard
309.1. The zone destroyed or used cards are placed in.

The standby area is a hidden zone but the player the zone belongs can see any information of cards in that zone.
311. Removed Area
311.1. The zone a player puts their removed cards in.
311.2. Each player has their own removed area, it’s public and the order of the cards is not managed.
311.2a. If an effect removes a card from game face down, treat the card as though it were in a hidden zone. Except for players that are allowed to see the information of the card.
311.3. Cards in a removed area are referred to as ‘removed cards’.
312. Chase Area
312.1. The zone played cards and abilities are placed in until they're resolved.
312.2. There is only one chase area, it’s public and order of the cards is managed.
312.3. While a card is placed in chase area, it's called "spell". If spells, abilities or effects refer to a "spell" without specific zone, they refer cards on chase area.
313. Play Ground
313.1. Fields and ruler areas are referred to as the play ground.
313.2. A card in a player's play ground is controlled by the player. If a card would be put in a player's play ground, it enters under that player's control.
314. Zone Movement Restriction
314.1. If a card that has ‘ruler’ as its printed card type would move to a zone other than a graveyard or ruler area except by playing a judgment process, it doesn't move. If a J-ruler card would move to a zone other than a ruler area or field, it doesn't move.
314.2. If a card that has ‘J-ruler’ as its printed card type would move to a zone other than a ruler area or field, it doesn't move.
314.3. If a card that has ‘resonator’, ‘addition’, or ‘regalia’ as its printed card type would move to another zone, the resulting movement depends on the zone it would move to.
314.3a. If that card would move to a ruler area, it does not move.
314.3b. If that card is, by some effect, treated as a magic stone or has gained the magic stone type and would move to a magic stone deck, it moves to the main deck with the same placement specifications instead. (ex. If that card would move to the top of the magic stone deck, it moves to the top of the main deck instead.) In cases that cannot be handled by this specification, the card does not move.
314.3c. In other instances, the card moves as specified.
314.4. If a card that has ‘chant’ as its printed card type would move to magic stone deck, or a play ground, it moves to the graveyard.
314.5. If a card that has ‘magic stone’ as its printed card type would move to another zone, the resulting movement depends on the zone it would move to.
314.5a. If that card would move to a ruler area, it does not move.
314.5b. If that card has, by some effect, gained one of the types ‘resonator’, ‘addition’, or ‘regalia’ and would move to a main deck, it moves to the magic stone deck with the same placement specifications instead. (ex. If that card would move to the bottom of the main deck, it moves to the bottom of the magic stone deck instead.) In cases that cannot be handled by this specification, the card does not move.
314.5c. If that card has, by some effect, gained one of the types ‘resonator’, ‘addition’, ‘regalia’ and would move to a hand, it moves to the top of the magic stone deck instead. In cases that cannot be handled by this specification, the card does not move.
314.5d. In other instances, the card moves as specified.
315. Out of the Game
315.1. If an effect refers to cards "out of the game", it refers to different cards depending on if the game is being played in a tournament or not.

402.5. In a main deck or magic stone deck, there can be up to four copies of any card with the same name. Non-special magic stone cards are the exception to this rule and you can put any number of them in a magic stone deck (as long as the total number of cards in the magic stone deck does not exceed 20).
402.6. If an effect replaces the deck building rules, it affects the rules only at this time. During a game, even if the ability that produces that effect is lost, the deck is still legal.

900.  Cards and Abilities
901. Ability and Effect
901.1. An ability is the sentences on a card that cause something to happen. Abilities can be "continuous ability", " activate ability " or "automatic ability".
901.1a. Activated abilities are abilities with text "[Activated] <cost> <effect>", and the controller of that abilities can play them at the time he or she allowed by performing all the cost.
901.1b. Automatic abilities are described as "<trigger condition> => <effect>". They're played in the next priority sequence after the triggering condition is met.
901.1c. Continuous abilities are described as "<effect>". Continuous abilities apply their effect as long as the abilities are active.
901.1d. Some abilities have ability names. An ability name is shown as <(name)>. If two abilities have the same ability name, they are treated as the same ability. Also, if something refers to an ability name, it refers an ability with that ability name.
901.1e. If "<information> ability" is referred to, it refers to "an ability of a card that is <information>". Example: 'Darkness ability' means "an ability of a darkness card".
901.2. An effect refers to the type of process described by an ability. Effects are based on how they’re applied. Effects can be "one time effect", "continuous effect" or "replacement effect".
901.2a. A one time effect is an effect to do something and end the application immediately after that.
901.2b. A continuous effect is an effect that is applied in some duration, or if there is no duration specified, applied as long as the ability is active.
901.2c. A replacement effect is an effect applied to a specific action that one would perform, and instead, not performing it and doing the replacement effect.
901.2d. If "<information> effect" is referred to, it refers to "an effect made by an ability of a card that is <information>". Example: 'Darkness effect' means "an effect made by an ability of a darkness card".
902. Active Ability
902.1. Each ability can be played or apply its effect as long as it's active. Unless otherwise specified, abilities are active as long as the card with them is in a zone as below:
902.1a. Abilities on a J/resonator, addition, regalia or magic stone are active while the card is in a field.
902.1b. Abilities on a ruler are active while the card is in a ruler area.
902.2. If an ability has text that is available in specified area, the ability is active in that specified area.
903. Play and Cards and Abilities
903.1. Cards are played and then placed in a specified zone. Activated or automatic abilities are played and then resolved.
903.2. Cards and abilities are played as below:
903.2a. If the card is a face down card in the standby area, flip it face it up.
903.2b. When a player plays a card, put that card into the chase area. When a player plays an ability, put that ability into the chase area as a pseudo-card.
903.2b-i. If a card that has gained a continuous effect dependent on its location (example: Cards in your hand gain ‘effect’) is played, the card does not lose that continuous effect until it leaves the chase.
903.2c. If a card or ability has the text "choose (number)", the player chooses that number of options in that text. Options not chosen are treated as if they didn't exist.
903.2d. If a card or ability’s text specifies an uncertain value represented by X or Y, determine its value at this time. If there is no method via cards or rules to determine the value of that integer, the player determines its value.
903.2d-i. If that card would be played via an effect that states ‘play that card without paying its cost’, if there is no rule or text that indicates a value of that integer, then that integer is always zero. Likewise, if a card or ability’s text would alter the cost of an uncertain cost represented by X or Y (Ex: You pay [2] to play this card this turn). The value of that integer is still zero.
903.2e. If the card or ability needs targets, the controller chooses legal ones. If they cannot choose a legal target, they cannot play the card or ability.
903.2e-i.  A card or ability on the chase cannot target itself. If some outside effect would cause that card or ability to target itself, it doesn’t happen.
903.2f. If a card or ability produces an effect that would be applied to multiple targets, and the amounts or properties of the effect’s contents are predetermined to be unequal among all targets, decide which target receives how much of the effect’s contents at this time. (Example: “Target two resonators. Destroy one, return one to its owner’s hand.”)
903.2f-i. Assigning damage to multiple targets is included in this stipulation. If such an event occurs where a player assigns damage to multiple resonators it must be assigned in multiples of 100.
903.2g. If that card or ability requires any sort of action to be played, handle those actions in the order detailed below;
903.2g-i. If there are any effects altering the quality, apply them first.
903.2g-ii. If there are any effects that allow one to “play without paying its cost”, if you play a card, remove paying the card’s cost (203). If you play an activate ability, remove the cost shown before the “:” of the ability.
903.2g-iii. Apply any effects increasing the quantity.
903.2g-iv. Apply any effects decreasing the quantity. To do this, the player who plays it chooses which part they decrease.
903.2g-v. Things to play are fixed. After this, even if some effects would alter this, the quality and quantity are not changed.
903.2h. Things to play are fixed. After this, even if some effects would alter this, the quality and quantity are not changed.
903.2h-i. If multiple actions are required, do them in the order they are written, from top to bottom, left to right.
903.3. Cards and abilities are resolved as below:
903.3a. If the card or ability requires you to choose target, check the target at this point. If it's not legal, all effects involving it are not applied. Even if all the targets of the card or ability are illegal, the other effects not related to the targets is still resolved.
903.3b. If it's a card, perform the action depending of the type of card it is. If it's an ability, apply the effect of the ability, then remove it from chase area.
903.3c. If the ability of a card specifies ‘X00’, it means a value of X times 100.
904. Continuous Ability
904.1. Continuous abilities apply their effects as long as the abilities are active. All the effects of continuous abilities are continuous effects.
904.2. If a continuous ability on a card refers to the attribute, race, trait, ATK, or DEF of cards without any condition, the ability is called a "base ability" and applied in any zone.
904.2a. Abilities with "treat this card as [magic stone type]" text are base abilities.
905. Activate Ability
905.1. Activated abilities are abilities that the controller of them may play them at any time they can play it.
905.2. Playing an activate ability follows the rules of playing abilities.
905.3. An activate ability of a resonator with {T} included in its required action can be played if it's been in your playground continuously from the beginning of this turn.
905.4. An activate ability of a J-ruler with {T} included in its required action can be played if it's been in your field continuously from the beginning of this turn.
906. Automatic Abilities
906.1. Abilities described as "<trigger condition> => <effect>" are automatic abilities. An automatic ability watches the game situation, and if its trigger condition is met, it's automatically played in the priority sequence.
906.2. An automatic card with [Trigger] in hand or standby area triggers by revealing it when its trigger condition is met. Then it's played in priority sequence as a spell.
906.2a. If an effect allows playing a card ‘without paying its cost’ and that card is an automatic object(s) that has not had all its triggering conditions met, that card still may not be played.
906.3. In these rules, automatic abilities and automatic cards are called automatic objects.
906.4. Each automatic object has it's own condition to play it. It's called triggering condition. If a condition on the automatic object is met, the number of times the automatic object triggered is increased by one. If an automatic object is triggered one or more times, the ability is considered "triggered".
906.4a. An automatic card in a standby area doesn't trigger on a turn that the card was put into that area.
906.5. During a priority sequence, after all rule processes have been resolved, the turn player checks if they control any triggered automatic objects. If they do, choose one of those objects and play it, then decrease the number of times that object was triggered by one. If the turn player doesn't play any automatic objects, then the non- turn player checks if they control any triggered automatic objects, choose one of those abilities and play it if there are any, then decrease the number of times that object was triggered by one.
906.5a. If any player played an automatic object, repeat this priority sequence from the beginning. If neither player played any automatic object, the turn player performs an available action.
906.6. Triggered automatic objects have to be played unless it is prohibited by rules or effects. Players cannot choose not to play them. If a player chooses an triggered automatic object but cannot play it for any reason, just decrease the number of times that object was triggered by one.
906.6a. If you cannot play the automatic card for any reason, put it into owner's graveyard.
906.7. Some automatic objects trigger when a card moves from one zone to another. If these objects refer to the moved card or other cards moved at the same time, they refer to the information or status of the card as below:
906.7a. If the card moved from a public zone to a hidden zone, or a hidden zone to a public zone, the ability refers to the card when it's in public zone.
906.7b. If the card moved from a play ground to an area other than a play ground, or vice versa, the ability refers the card when it's in the play ground.
906.7c. Otherwise, the ability refers to a card when it's in destination zone.
906.8. Some effects make automatic abilities trigger later at a specific time. This ability is called a delayed automatic ability.
906.8a. A delayed automatic ability is, unless otherwise specified, triggered once and once only at the time it specified. After that, even in the same situation, it doesn't trigger again.
906.8b. If something refers to a card with a delayed automatic ability, it refers a card with an ability that makes that delayed trigger ability.
906.9. Some automatic objects watch if a specific status is fulfilled during a game. These objects are called status automatic objects.
906.9a. A status automatic object is only triggered when it's not already triggered and the status is fulfilled.
906.10. When a player plays their automatic ability, it is possible the card with that ability moved to another zone, lost the automatic ability, or the ability became inactive. Even in these cases, the ability is still played and resolved. If a triggered automatic card is in a different zone from the zone the card was in at the time it triggered when you would play it, you cannot play it.
907. Will Abilities and Produced Will
907.1. Activate abilities that need no target and produce wills are will abilities. Automatic abilities that trigger by playing a will ability, need no target, and produce wills are will abilities. Spells that produce wills are not will abilities.
907.2. A player can play will abilities while they have priority or when they need to pay wills.
907.3. Will abilities don't use the chase area and are resolved just after they are played.
907.4. Produced wills are kept by the controller of the abilities. They are left until they are used to paid for something, or cease to exist by the rules.
907.5. Wills with an attribute are attribute will, specified by a will symbol. :one light,  :one fire,  :one water,  :one wind,  :one darkness :one will without attribution (same for the other numbers)
907.6. Some wills have a specific characteristic.
907.6a. Some wills have the characteristic "moon". "Produce  " means "produce one will with the moon characteristic without any attribute".
907.6b. A characteristic is not an attribute.
908. One Time Effect
908.1. One time effects are performed when they resolve.
909. Continuous Effect
909.1. If two or more continuous effects are applied, they are applied in the order below:
909.1a. Information on the card itself and base abilities on the card are the base information.
909.1b. Apply all continuous effects that add or remove any ability.
909.1c. Apply all continuous effects that change non-value information.
909.1d. Apply all non-counter continuous effects that change value information.
909.1e. Apply all continuous effects of counters that change value information.
909.1f. After applying all continuous effects, if a card's ATK or DEF is not a multiple of 100, round up the value to the nearest multiple of 100 as long as the same continuous effects are applied to the card.
909.2. If a continuous effect contains multiple layers of the above, apply them separately according to the order above.
909.3. If two or more continuous effects are applied at the same time in the above conditions, apply them in the order below:
909.3a. If there are effect A and effect B, and if applying A before B changes what or how B applies, then you apply A after B, B is considered dependent on A. If effect B depends on effect A and A doesn't depend B, B is always applied after A.
909.3b. If the order is not decided after this, apply the effect earlier applied first. The timing of an effect applied is determined as this; at the time the continuous ability became active, or the time the effect is made by an ability. In the case of an addition added to a card where that addition creates a continuous effect, the effect becomes active when the addition is added onto that card. If, for any reason the timing is still the same, the turn player at the time decides which one applies first.
909.4. If a continuous effect is made by an automatic ability, an activate ability or a spell, and if it applies to any cards with certain conditions, that are not specific cards, it applies to any cards fulfilling those conditions, no matter when the card starts to fulfill the condition. Also, it stops to apply if the card stops fulfilling the condition. In this case, conditions are part of that continuous effect. It is not checked when the effect is made, and the effect is made whether the condition is met or not. Ex. If you play and resolve "Knight of the Round Table J/resonators you control gain +200/+200." spell, J/resonators put into your field after that still gains +200/+200. Ex. If you play and resolve an activate ability "If your J-ruler is "Faria, the Ruler of God Sword", you may pay [2] less to play its God's Art this turn." while you don't control any J-ruler, then you control "Faria, the Ruler of God Sword" after that, you may pay [2] less to play its God's Art.
909.5. When a card is moved to a zone and any continuous effect is applied to the card in the new zone, the card comes into the zone with the effect applied.
909.6. If a continuous effect changes the information of cards to something else, it loses the older information.
909.7. If something refers to the 'printed' information of a card, it refers to the information of the card without any continuous effects applied.
909.8. If an activate ability or an automatic ability makes a continuous effect, and the duration is defined with "as long as <condition that refers information or status of this card>", the effect is not made if the condition become "off" after the ability played and before it's resolved.

910.2. If two or more replacement effects are applied, the player of the original situation, or the controller of the card or effect of the original situation chooses a replacement effect and applies it.
910.2a. If there're more than one replacement effects for dealing damage and at least one of them doesn't contains prevention effect, the controller of the effect dealing that damage choose one of them that contains no damage prevention effects and apply it. If there're more than one replacement effects for dealing damage and all of them contain prevention effect, the player of the controller of the card that would be dealt that damage choose one of them and apply it.
910.3. All replacement effects must be applied once and once only if the situation that should be replaced occurred. Players cannot choose not to replace it unless the effect allows them to do so.
911. Last Known Information
911.1. If, for any reason, any information of a card in a zone should be referred to but the card has moved to another zone, if it has not moved from play ground to play ground, information of the card in the former zone is referred to. This is called last known information.

1126. [Inheritance]
1126.1. Inheritance is an activate ability
1126.2. ‘[Inheritance] (Cost): (Effect)’ means ‘Pay the (cost), discard this card from your hand: (Effect)’.

1127.3. If a card with [Resonance] is or is treated as the specified (Kind of Magic Stone) on its own ability, it causes its own [Resonance] ability to trigger when it enters the field.
1200.  Rule Process
1201. General
1201.1. During a game, if some specific situation is happening, actions by rules are performed. This is called rule process.
1202. Losing the Game
1202.1. If a player's life points are 0 or less, the player loses the game by rule process.
1202.2. After the most recent rule process, if a player needed to draw cards from his main deck and there were less cards in it than the number need to draw in his or her draw phase, the player lose the game by rule process.
1203. Destroying
1203.1. If a J/resonator with DEF in a field suffers damage equal to or more than its DEF, the J/resonator is destroyed by rule process.
1203.2. If a J/resonator with DEF in a field has 0 or less DEF, the J/resonator is destroyed by rule process.
1204. Rounding up life point
1204.1. If a player's life points are not multiple of 100, round that player’s life points up to the nearest multiple of 100.
1205. Illegal Addition Handling
1205.1. If, by some method, an addition would be added to itself, it is not added by rule process.
1300.  Other Rules
1301. Loop
1301.1. During a game, it is possible to be in a situation that a player or players can repeat specific actions as many times as possible, or be forced to repeat specific actions indefinitely. This situation is called a loop, and it follows the rules below: 1301.1a. If only one player can stop the loop, they declare the number of times the loop will be performed, then do it that many times. After that, the player has to perform another action to perform the loop again.
1301.1b. If both players can stop the loop, the turn player declares the number of times the loop will be performed, and non-turn player does the same, then perform the loop the smaller number of times among them. After that, the player has to perform another action to perform the loop again.
1301.1c. If nobody can stop the loop, the game ends in a draw.
1302. Double-Sided Card
1302.1. Some of the non-ruler cards have printed information on both sides of them. These cards are called double-sided cards.
1302.1a. Most ruler cards also have printed information on both sides, but they're not considered double-sided cards under these rules.
1302.1b. If a non-double-sided card becomes a copy of another double-sided card, the former is not considered a double-sided card. In the same way, if a double- sided card becomes a copy of a non-double-sided card, the former is still considered a double-sided card.
1302.2. One side of a double-sided card has a [Shift] (1117) ability in its text. The side with the [Shift] ability is referred to as the 'past side', and the other side is referred to as the 'future side'.
1302.2a. A card is past (or future) side up 'physically' if the card is double-sided and its printed text contains (or doesn't contain) a [Shift] ability.
1302.2b. While a double-sided card is past (or future) side up physically and is in a public zone, put the card in that zone with the past (or future) side visible.
1302.2c. If something turns a double-sided card past (or future) side up, flip the card past (or future) side up physically in that zone. Even if a double-faced card changes which side is physically up in a zone, it's still the same card. Any effects or counters on that card are not changed.
1302.2d. On a future side up card, the card type contains the phrase '(Shift)'. This is considered a reminder, and does not have any specific rules. Ex. If a card type is "Resonator (Shift)", it is considered a "Resonator".
1302.2e. While a double-sided card is past (or future) side up physically, that card only has the information on that side. Ignore any information on the other side.
1302.3. A double-sided card in a zone is always physically past side up, except for when it's in a field or chase area, or when a player starts to play that card. You always refer to the past side's information if you refer to the card when it is not in a field or chase area.
1302.3a. If a double-sided card moves to a zone by a non-playing, non-resolving method, and the movement is anything other than from playground to playground, the card moves to the new zone physically past side up.
1302.3b. If a player can see either side of a double-sided card, they can see the information of both sides.
1302.4. If a card becomes a copy of a double-sided card, it becomes the original information of the physically face up side of the double-sided card, without any continuous effects on it. It doesn't copy any information of the other side, regardless of whether the card is double-sided or not.
1302.5. If you use double-sided cards in your deck, you need to use opaque sleeves, such that you are not able to distinguish double-sided cards from other cards.
1302.5a. If an effect removes a double-sided card from the game face down, same as if you were moving it to a hidden zone, move the card while not showing any information to any players, except for players that are allowed to see the information of the card.
1303. Tokens
1303.1. Some effects create tokens.
1303.1a. A token has information like a card. If something refers to a token's printed information, it refers to the information specified by the effect that created the token.
1303.1b. If the effect creating the token doesn't specify its type, the token type is resonator.
1303.1c. Unless otherwise specified, tokens are put into the field of the player who controls the effect creating the token.
1303.1d. If an effect creates "<name> token", its name and race become <name>.
1303.2. Unless otherwise specified by rules, tokens are treated as cards.
1303.2a. If you choose a card in a field, you can choose tokens. If an effect is applied to cards in a field, it's also applied to tokens.
1303.2b. If an effect is applied to tokens specifically, it's not applied to cards.
1303.3. "Erase a token from existence" means "to remove the token from that area and do not put it in any area".
1303.3a. If a token moves from a field to a non-field area, it moves to that area then ceases to exist immediately after that.
1304. Colossal Ruler
1304.1. A colossal ruler is two normal sized cards attached such that they fold to reveal a larger card (in this case, a J-ruler) when unfolded or two cards opposite each other when folded up (in this case a ruler and J-ruler).
1304.2. Colossal ruler cards have a normal sized ruler side, a 1st form J-ruler that is normal size, and a 2nd form J-ruler that is double the size of a normal card.
1304.2a. When using the ruler or 1st form J-ruler side, the colossal ruler card must be folded and placed such that the relevant side’s information is viewable.
1304.2b. When using the 2nd form J-ruler you must unfold the card and place it such that the 2nd form J-ruler is face up and easily viewable.
1304.2b-i. The orientation (recovered or rested) of a 2nd form J-ruler is based on the J-ruler itself, not the shape of the two cards forming its image. A recovered 2nd form J-ruler is facing such that its information and picture are facing vertically. Likewise, a rested 2nd form J-ruler is facing such that its information is facing horizontally.
1304.3. While a Colossal Ruler card is a ruler, it must be folded and displayed with its ruler information face up and viewable.
1304.4. When the Judgment process of a ruler that is part of a Colossal Ruler card is used and subsequently resolved, that ruler becomes its 1st form J-ruler side. When it becomes its 1st form J-ruler side, it should be flipped to the 1st J-ruler form to reflect this properly.
1304.4a. If a 1st form J-ruler is destroyed it is treated exactly the same as a non-Colossal Ruler card J-ruler destruction, including the “Astral” condition (1010.1a).
1304.5. If the 1st form J-ruler of a Colossal Ruler card has a [Judgment] ability, it may use it in the same way a ruler would (705).
1304.5a. When the Judgment process of a 1st form J-ruler is used and subsequently resolved, that J-ruler becomes its 2nd form J-ruler side. When it becomes its 2nd form J-ruler side, it should be opened to the 2nd J-ruler form to reflect this properly.
1304.5a-i. A Judgment process of a 1st form J-ruler to change into a 2nd form J-ruler triggers automatic objects with the condition of “doing Judgment” at the same time the Judgment process of a ruler changing to a J-ruler would.
1304.5b. If, by the [Judgment] ability of a 1st form J-ruler, a Judgment process is played and during the resolution of that Judgment process that 1st form J-ruler is absent (destroyed before resolution, or other such situation) that Judgment process still resolves, but does nothing. (This includes not triggering automatic objects with the condition of “doing Judgment”.)
1304.5c. If a 2nd form J-ruler is destroyed treat it the same as if the 1st form J-ruler had been destroyed. It returns to its ruler side in the ruler area and gains the “Astral” condition.
1304.6. Regardless of whether a Colossal Ruler card is in its ruler, 1st form J-ruler, or 2nd form J-ruler, it is still the same card. Any effect that applies to the card as a whole applies to the Colossal Ruler card, regardless of what side is currently being used. Even if a Colossal Ruler card’s side would change (Ex: from ruler to 1st form J-ruler via Judgment) its orientation remains the same.
1400.  Old rules and wordings
1401.  General
1401.1. This section contains the rules and wordings used on cards in the Alice cluster and before ("old cards") and how they are treated in the current rules.
1402. Referring card name
1402.1. (Rules for Japanese cards only).

1405. Type "Spell: Chant"
1405.1. Treat the type "spell" on old cards as "chant". It doesn't have any subtypes.
1405.2. Ignore the “chant” subtypes on all cards.
1405.2a. If an old card refers to "spell: chant", it refers to "chant".

1406. Addition with subtypes
1406.1. All of the old addition cards have subtypes.
1406.1a. Old additions have the subtypes "field", "resonator", "ruler", "J-ruler", "J/resonator" or "J/ruler". If something refers an old addition with "resonator" subtype, it doesn't refer additions with "J/resonator" and vice versa. The same rule is applied for the subtypes "Ruler" and "J/ruler", "J-ruler" and "J/resonator" or "J/ruler".
1406.2. Most additions need a target as you play them.
1406.2a. If the card is not an [Addition: Field], it needs a target when it is played. The target must be a card in a field and have type X, X is specified with [Addition: X].
1406.2b. When an addition card in the chase area resolves, if the card targets another card and the target is still legal, it comes into its controller's field added to the targeted card. If the target is not legal, put the addition into its owner's graveyard.
1406.3. If an effect moves a non-[Addition: Field] addition with a subtype from a non- chase area to a field, It comes into the field added on a card it can legally be added to. "Card it can legally be added to" means a card in a field that has the type that is specified in the subtype of the addition, and no effects prevent the addition from being added. If there is no such card, the addition stays in the zone its currently in.
1406.4. A rule process is applied to additions with subtypes.
1406.4a. If an addition with a subtype other than [Addition: Field] is in a field, and it's not added to any card, or it's added to an illegal card, or the addition is added to itself, the addition is put into its owner's graveyard by rule process.
1407. Spells
1407.1. If an old card refers to a "summon spell", it refers to a "resonator spell".
1407.2. If an old card refers to a "normal spell", it refers to a "non-resonator spell".

1411. Automatic Abilities
1411.1. Automatic abilities on old cards written as "When <condition>, <effect>", "Whenever <condition>, <effect>" or "At <condition>, <effect>", treat them as "<When/Whenever/At> <condition> => <effect>".
1411.1a. Treat [Trigger] abilities with the text "<condition>: <effect>" as "<condition> => <effect>".
1411.2. If an old card has an "[Enter] <effect>" ability, it's an automatic ability.
1411.2a. If the card is a J-ruler, the ability means "When this card comes into your field by performing a judgment process => <effect>".
1411.2b. If the card is a non-J-ruler, the ability means "When this card comes into your field from chase area after played from your hand => <effect>".
1412. Action by Rules
1412.1. (Rules for Japanese cards only).
1412.2. "To summon" on old cards means "to put onto the top of the chase area as a spell". If a rule or an ability refers to a resonator being "summoned", it refers to a resonator being "put into a field from the chase area by resolving itself".
1412.3. (Rules for Japanese cards only).
1413. Symbol Skill
1413.1. Some old cards refer to "symbol skill".
1413.2. If a card has [Pierce], [Precision], [First Strike], [Explode], [Flying], [Swiftness] or [Imperishable], it's considered having a symbol skill. If a card refers to "symbol skill", it refers one of the skills above.
1414. [Target Attack]
1414.1. Treat the [Target Attack] ability on old cards as [Precision].
1414.2. When a text refers to [Precision]., it also refers to Target Attack] and vice versa.
1415. Life Break and Valhalla Rules
1415.1. If you start a game using with old cards, if both players agreed, you may use Valhalla rules, which allow the use of lifebreak. If you use Valhalla rules, the following rules are applied.
1415.1a. Players use the "lifebreak area" zones.
1415.1a-i.  A lifebreak area is the zone a player puts their cards in for lifebreak. Each player has their own lifebreak area, it’s hidden and the order of the cards is managed. Any new cards put into a lifebreak area are put on top of the cards already in the lifebreak area.
1415.1a-ii. Each player has a maximum lifebreak size. At the beginning of a game, each player's maximum lifebreak size is four.
1415.1b. Players use the keyword skill [Break].
1415.1b-i.  The [Break] ability is an ability with a one time effect as you perform lifebreak (1415.1d).
1415.1b-ii. "[Break] <effect>" means "As you put this card into your removed area by performing lifebreak, play an ability with <effect> on its text as a [Break] ability if possible." .
1415.1c. As you set up your game, each player moves the top four cards from their main deck to their lifebreak area after each player has finalized their opening hand.
1415.1d. The player with priority may perform lifebreak.
1415.1d-i.  The player with priority may remove the top card in their lifebreak area if the number of cards in the area is larger than [(their life points- 1)/1000] (rounded down).
1415.1d-ii. If the removed card has a [Break] ability, that player must play the ability as long as they can play it legally.
1415.1d-iii. A card removed in this way is put into its owner’s graveyard immediately if it doesn't have a [Break] ability or the ability cannot be played legally. If the [Break] ability is played, put the card into its owner's graveyard when the ability is removed from the chase area.
1415.1e. A rule process is applied to cards in a lifebreak area.
1415.1e-i.  If cards in a lifebreak area contain more cards than the player's maximum lifebreak size, choose cards from the bottom in the area and put the other cards into their owner's graveyard.
1415.2. If you don't use Valhalla rules and an effect refers to cards or a number or cards in a lifebreak area, or moves a card from or to a lifebreak area, ignore that part of the effect. Also, ignore all [Break] abilities on all cards.
1416. Reading and Handling [Trigger] and [Stealth] cards
1416.1. [Trigger] abilities shall henceforth be read as detailed below.
1416.1a. For the purposes of simplification, the stipulations listed here apply to [Trigger] abilities as well as [Stealth] abilities, even though only [Trigger] is listed in the examples.
1416.2. Depending on the (Triggering condition) of such an ability as detailed here; [Trigger] (Triggering condition): (Effect), the type of the [Trigger] ability may differ.
1416.2a. If the (Triggering condition) describes a certain time or step in the game or details a specific time defined by the occurrence of a certain event then it is to be played like an automatic ability. That point in time is when the card triggers. Examples: “At end of turn” or “When a resonator enters your opponent’s field”, Prison in the Lunar Lake
1416.2b. If the (Triggering condition) indicates an event that occurred in the past or if it triggers from a current static event then it is to be played like an activate ability. Example: “If your life is 1000 or less.” “You control three or more water magic stones”, Riza, First of the Dead, Flame Trap
1416.2c. If the (Triggering condition) indicates a required action in order to play it, then it is to be played like an activate ability. Example: “Pay [3]”, “Discard a card”
1416.3. A [Trigger] ability that is to be played like an automatic ability that contains a (play requirement) or (cost) is still considered to be played like an automatic ability. However, any (play requirement) must be met when you play that card. Likewise, any (cost) must be paid when you play that card. Example: “When a resonator your opponent controls attacks, pay [3]”
1416.4. A [Trigger] ability that is to be played like an activate ability as described by [Trigger] (Cost): (Effect) that also contains a (play requirement) must have any (play requirement) met when you play that card.
1416.4a. If such an ability lists no cost, treat it as if that card said “Pay [0]”.
